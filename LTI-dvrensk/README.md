## Principal use cases

### Use Case 1: Candidate Resume Submission & Parsing

![Use Case 1](Candidate_Resume_Submission.svg)

Explanation:
* The Candidate uploads their resume into the ATS system.
* The system automatically parses the resume using AI/NLP to extract structured data such as candidate name, contact info, skills, and experience.
* The extracted data is then validated for accuracy and completeness.
* Once validated, a candidate profile is automatically created and made available for the Recruiter to review and act upon.

This process significantly reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and accelerates initial candidate evaluation.

### Use Case 2: AI-driven Candidate Screening & Ranking

![Use Case 2](AI_Candidate_Screening_Ranking.svg)

Explanation:
* The Recruiter initiates AI-driven screening within the ATS.
* The system analyzes candidate profiles and resumes, applying AI and machine learning algorithms to assess qualifications and match job requirements.
* Candidates are automatically scored and ranked based on AI analysis.
* A clearly organized and prioritized list of candidates is generated, allowing the Recruiter to quickly review and focus on the most promising applicants.

This AI-driven process significantly streamlines candidate evaluation and prioritization, ensuring recruiters spend their time efficiently on high-quality candidates.

### Use Case 3: Conversational Chatbot Screening

![Use Case 3](Conversational_Chatbot_Screening.svg)

Explanation:
* The Candidate initiates interaction with the ATS via an AI-powered conversational chatbot.
* The chatbot conducts an initial screening, asking tailored questions to gather candidate details, clarify skills, and evaluate basic qualifications.
* The chatbot also answers candidate queries, providing immediate support and information, enhancing candidate experience.
* After the interaction, the system automatically generates a structured screening report, which is provided to the Recruiter for efficient review and further action.

This conversational screening method greatly enhances candidate engagement and significantly reduces manual recruiter workload at the earliest stage of recruitment.
