# Prioritized Backlog for Adaptive Talent Intelligence ATS

## Release 1: MVP (Must Have)

2. **#1: AI-Powered Candidate Matching (Must Have)** - As the core differentiator and a "Must Have" performance feature, this enables the primary value proposition of the platform and creates immediate recruiter productivity despite moderate technical complexity.

3. **#2: Personalized Candidate Dashboard (Must Have)** - This completes the essential candidate journey while balancing the focus on recruiter tools, providing a "Must Have" feature with high value-to-effort ratio and immediate satisfaction impact.

7. **#8: Recruitment Analytics (Should Have)** - This "Should Have" performance feature enables data-driven decision making but requires other features to be in place first to generate meaningful analytics data.

8. **#6: Talent Pool Management (Could Have)** - This "Could Have" feature provides significant pipeline management value with a favorable value-to-effort ratio, extending recruitment capabilities beyond immediate hiring needs.

9. **#7: Interview Guidance System (Could Have)** - As a "Could Have" attractive feature, this enhances the candidate evaluation journey but has specialized use and lower immediate impact than higher-ranked features.

## Release 4: Future Development (Won't Have)

10. **#4: Automated Compliance Engine (Won't Have)** - Though important for risk management, this "Won't Have" (for initial release) feature has extreme implementation complexity and can be addressed through manual compliance checks initially.
