# Product Backlog - Adaptive Talent Intelligence ATS (Kano Model Prioritization)

## Must-Be Features (Basic Expectations)

1. **Mobile-optimized Application Process** (User Story #9)
   - Kano Classification: Must-Be
   - Justification: In today's digital environment, mobile application processes are a basic expectation. If missing, users will be significantly dissatisfied, but their presence doesn't create extraordinary satisfaction since they're considered standard functionality in modern systems.

2. **HR Tech Stack Integration** (User Story #5)
   - Kano Classification: Must-Be
   - Justification: Enterprise customers expect seamless integration with existing systems as a fundamental requirement. The absence of integration capabilities would cause major dissatisfaction and potentially disqualify the product from consideration.

## Performance Features (The More, The Better)

3. **AI-Powered Candidate Matching** (User Story #1)
   - Kano Classification: Performance
   - Justification: The quality and accuracy of AI matching directly correlates with user satisfaction. Better matching algorithms create proportionally higher satisfaction, while poor matching creates proportional dissatisfaction. This feature's effectiveness is measurable and directly impacts key performance indicators.

4. **Recruitment Analytics** (User Story #8)
   - Kano Classification: Performance
   - Justification: The depth, accuracy, and usability of analytics have a linear relationship with user satisfaction. More comprehensive and actionable analytics create higher satisfaction, while limited analytics reduce satisfaction proportionally.

5. **Collaborative Candidate Evaluation** (User Story #3)
   - Kano Classification: Performance
   - Justification: The effectiveness of collaboration tools directly impacts team hiring decisions. Better collaboration features lead to proportionally higher satisfaction, making this a clear performance attribute where quality and depth matter.

## Attractive Features (Delighters)

6. **Bias Detection in Job Descriptions** (User Story #10)
   - Kano Classification: Attractive
   - Justification: This feature exceeds basic expectations and provides unexpected value. Users don't necessarily expect automated bias detection, but its presence creates disproportionate satisfaction and positive differentiation in the market.

7. **Interview Guidance System** (User Story #7)
   - Kano Classification: Attractive
   - Justification: Tailored interview guidance is not an expected feature in most ATS systems, making it a delighter that creates significant satisfaction when discovered. Its absence wouldn't cause dissatisfaction as users don't typically expect this functionality.

8. **Automated Compliance Engine** (User Story #4)
   - Kano Classification: Attractive
   - Justification: Automatic application of region-specific regulations exceeds standard expectations. While basic compliance features are expected, this level of automation represents a surprising capability that creates disproportionate satisfaction.

## One-Dimensional Features (Satisfiers)

9. **Personalized Candidate Dashboard** (User Story #2)
   - Kano Classification: One-Dimensional
   - Justification: The presence of this feature creates satisfaction proportional to its quality, while its absence creates proportional dissatisfaction. This is becoming an industry standard but still provides visible value when well-implemented.

10. **Talent Pool Management** (User Story #6)
    - Kano Classification: One-Dimensional
    - Justification: The capability to manage talent pools is explicitly requested by users and creates satisfaction proportional to its effectiveness. Its absence would cause proportional dissatisfaction among recruiters who expect this functionality.

## Implementation Priority Based on Kano Classification

### Highest Priority
1. Must-Be features (Mobile application, Integration)
2. Performance features with high technical feasibility (AI Matching, Collaborative Evaluation)

### Medium Priority
3. One-Dimensional features (Candidate Dashboard, Talent Pool Management)
4. Remaining Performance features (Recruitment Analytics)

### Lower Priority (Post-MVP)
5. Attractive features (Bias Detection, Interview Guidance, Automated Compliance)

## Implementation Strategy Justification

This prioritization using the Kano Model is based on several key principles:

### Foundational Requirements First
Must-Be features form the foundation of the product. Without mobile application capabilities and integration options, the product would fail to meet basic market expectations. These must be implemented first to ensure baseline acceptability.

### Core Value Drivers Next
Performance features that directly impact key workflows (AI matching and collaborative evaluation) are prioritized next because:
- They represent core differentiators in the market
- Their quality has a direct, measurable impact on user satisfaction
- They form the primary value proposition of the product

### Standard Expected Features
One-dimensional features are implemented next as they represent expected functionality that users explicitly request. These features provide satisfaction proportional to their quality and are important for competitive positioning.

### Delighters Last
Attractive features are scheduled later because:
- Their absence won't cause significant dissatisfaction initially
- They provide maximum impact when added to an already solid product foundation
- They often require the groundwork laid by more fundamental features
- They create marketing opportunities for feature updates and releases

### Special Considerations

1. **Market Evolution Awareness**: Features can shift categories over time. For example, bias detection (currently Attractive) may become One-Dimensional or Must-Be as DEI initiatives become more standardized. This requires continuous reassessment.

2. **Technical Dependencies**: Some features (like the Automated Compliance Engine) are classified as Attractive but may have components that underpin Must-Be functionalities. The implementation strategy accounts for these dependencies.

3. **Customer Segment Variation**: Different customer segments may categorize features differently. Enterprise customers might consider Analytics a Must-Be while SMBs might view it as Attractive. This prioritization reflects the primary target market segment.

This Kano-based approach ensures that the product meets basic expectations first, then systematically adds features that provide proportional satisfaction, ending with unexpected delighters that create market differentiation and customer advocacy.
