# BACKLOG  
For the backlog I will generate one backlog using each one of the following methods:
1. Valor 
2. MOSCoW
3. Kano
4. Cost of delay
5. User story maps

All the results where very pertinents and also quite similar, there were of course discrepencies. My first prefered results where for MoSCoW (it makes a lot of sense in this phase of the product) and Kano (I found it also very interesting for this phase).
But as I do not have experience in building backlog and also all of the methodologies have very interesting approaches, I decided to make a comparison work between all of them. This comparison can be found in the documentation/backlog_comparison.md file. 
This comparison also provide a suggestion for how to mix all of the methodologies and the reason to mix them in a certain order. 
These arguments made sense so I decided to follow this mixing suggestion. From this all file I then ask Claude to generate a prompt to build a prioritized backlog following the recommendations. Once again the result is quite similar to all the other one but it conforts me in the idea that using all of them ensure that all the aspects have been taken into account.

Here is the final backlog prioritized:

## Prioritized Backlog for Adaptive Talent Intelligence ATS

### Release 1: MVP (Must Have)

1. **#9: Mobile-optimized Application Process (Must Have)** - This feature is consistently ranked highest across all methodologies as it provides essential candidate experience with relatively low implementation effort and represents a foundational "Must-Be" requirement.

2. **#1: AI-Powered Candidate Matching (Must Have)** - As the core differentiator and a "Must Have" performance feature, this enables the primary value proposition of the platform and creates immediate recruiter productivity despite moderate technical complexity.

3. **#2: Personalized Candidate Dashboard (Must Have)** - This completes the essential candidate journey while balancing the focus on recruiter tools, providing a "Must Have" feature with high value-to-effort ratio and immediate satisfaction impact.

4. **#3: Collaborative Candidate Evaluation (Must Have)** - This rounds out the walking skeleton for the evaluation journey as a "Must Have" feature, ensuring teams can make hiring decisions collaboratively and representing a key workflow component.

### Release 2: Important Enhancement (Should Have)

5. **#10: Bias Detection in Job Descriptions (Should Have)** - Though a "Should Have" feature, this attractive differentiator has a high value-to-effort ratio and completes an essential component of the pipeline management journey.

6. **#5: HR Tech Stack Integration (Should Have)** - Despite varying prioritization across methodologies, this "Must-Be" feature is essential for enterprise adoption and scaled usage, though implementation complexity positions it after core features.

7. **#8: Recruitment Analytics (Should Have)** - This "Should Have" performance feature enables data-driven decision making but requires other features to be in place first to generate meaningful analytics data.

### Release 3: Desirable Enhancements (Could Have)

8. **#6: Talent Pool Management (Could Have)** - This "Could Have" feature provides significant pipeline management value with a favorable value-to-effort ratio, extending recruitment capabilities beyond immediate hiring needs.

9. **#7: Interview Guidance System (Could Have)** - As a "Could Have" attractive feature, this enhances the candidate evaluation journey but has specialized use and lower immediate impact than higher-ranked features.

### Release 4: Future Development (Won't Have)

10. **#4: Automated Compliance Engine (Won't Have)** - Though important for risk management, this "Won't Have" (for initial release) feature has extreme implementation complexity and can be addressed through manual compliance checks initially.
