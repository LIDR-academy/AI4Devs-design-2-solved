# Prompt

You are a high skilled prompt engineer. I want you to generate a prompt for Claude 3.7 sonnet that based on #LTI-JSB.md file containing the PRD, design, use cases and diagrams in #diagrams for the startup LTI new's ATS, creates the product roadmap containing the epics, user stories, having into account the next good practices but not limiting to them and ask me.

# Characteristics of User Stories

User Stories describe a software feature from the end user's perspective.

The most important characteristics that User Stories must fulfill to serve their purpose are:

1. **Informal description in natural language**: User Stories describe software features in a simple, non-technical way, from the user's point of view. Storytelling is important; it's not a technical description, and if it can be linked to the avatar / buyer persona / user who demands it, even better.
2. **User-focused**: User Stories focus on what the user wants to achieve, rather than on the technical functionalities of the system.
3. **Classic structure**: They generally follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want [to perform an action] to [obtain a benefit]."
4. **Prioritization and estimation**: User Stories are prioritized, and they are assigned an estimated effort by the development team in case it is one of the variables to be taken into account in prioritization.
5. **Conversation and confirmation**: User Stories encourage conversation between product managers, stakeholders, and the technical team, and are confirmed once the functionality has been implemented.
6. **Iterative evolution**: As the project progresses, User Stories can evolve and change to adapt to changing needs.

## How to create good user stories

### Focus on the user:

- User stories should be written from the perspective of the end user, not from the internal perspective of the organization.
- Use characters or "personas" to better understand the needs and goals of users.

### Keep a simple and concise format:

- Follow the standard format: "As a [type of user], I want [to perform an action] to [obtain a benefit]."
- Avoid technical details or implementation instructions.
- Keep stories small enough to be deliverable in a sprint.

### Prioritize and estimate:

- Prioritize user stories based on their value to the business and the user.
- Estimate the effort required to implement each story.

### Encourage collaboration:

- Write user stories collaboratively with the development team.
- Use user stories as a starting point for deeper conversations.

### Include acceptance criteria:

- Clearly define the criteria that must be met to consider a story "done."
- Avoid focusing on how the functionality will be built.

### Keep stories updated:

- Be prepared to evolve and refine stories as the project progresses.
- Use techniques such as User Story Mapping to organize and prioritize stories.

By following these steps, effective user stories can be created that maintain focus on user needs, facilitate team collaboration, and guide product development in an agile and value-centered manner.

## Basic Structure of a User Story

1. **Standard format**: "As a [type of user], I want [to perform an action] to [obtain a benefit]."
2. **Description**: A concise description in natural language of the functionality the user desires.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific conditions that must be met to consider the User Story "done," these should follow a format similar to "Given that" [initial context], "when" [action performed], "then" [expected result].
4. **Additional notes**: Notes that may help in the development of the story
5. **Tasks**: List of tasks and subtasks for this story to be completed

## Examples of User Stories

1. **Product Development**: "As a product manager, I want a way for team members to understand how individual tasks contribute to goals, so they can better prioritize their work."
2. **Customer Experience**: "As a returning customer, I expect my information to be saved to create a smoother payment experience, so I can complete my purchases quickly and easily."
3. **Mobile Application**: "As a frequent user of the application, I want a way to simplify relevant information as quickly as possible, so I can efficiently access the information I need."

These examples show how User Stories focus on the needs and goals of end users, rather than on technical functionalities. The simple structure and natural language help all team members, including non-technical stakeholders, to understand and collaborate in product development.

## Complete Example:

**User Story Title:**

1. As a [user role],
2. I want [action the user wants to perform],
3. so that [benefit the user expects to obtain].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. [Specific functionality detail]
2. [Specific functionality detail]
3. [Specific functionality detail]

**Additional Notes:**

- [Any additional considerations]

**Related User Stories:**

- [Relationships with other user stories]

1. **Clear and Concise Title**

A brief summary that reflects the essence of the task. It should be descriptive enough for any team member to quickly understand what the ticket is about.

2. **Detailed Description**

Purpose: Explanation of why the task is necessary and what problem it solves.
Specific Details: Additional information about specific requirements, constraints, or conditions necessary for the completion of the task.

3. **Acceptance Criteria**

Clear Expectations: Detailed list of conditions that must be met for the work on the ticket to be considered completed.
Validation Tests: Specific steps or tests that must be performed to verify that the task has been completed correctly.

4. **Priority**

Level of Urgency: A classification of the importance and urgency of the task, which helps determine the order in which tasks within the backlog should be addressed.

5. **Effort Estimation**

Story Points or Estimated Time: An assessment of the time or effort expected to complete the ticket. This is essential for team planning and time management.

6. **Assignment**

Responsible: Who or which team will be responsible for completing the task. This ensures that all involved understand who is in charge of each part of the project.

7. **Labels or Tags**

Categorization: Tags that help classify the ticket by type (bug, improvement, task, etc.), by product features (UI, backend, etc.), or by sprint/version.

8. **Comments and Notes**

Collaboration: Space for team members to add relevant information, ask questions, or provide updates on task progress.

9. **Links or References**

  These 12 tickets cover the implementation of the first two user stories from the LTI ATS Product Roadmap. They include a mix of research, technical tasks, feature development, and testing to ensure a complete and secure implementation of the user registration and authentication functionality.

# Prompt

Adjust the story points for each ticket taking into account that sprints consist of 2 weeks and the development team is composed by 4 fullstack developers, 2 of them are senior and 2 of them junior.

# Response

# Adjusted Story Points for Work Tickets

I'll adjust the story points for each ticket considering:

- 2-week sprints
- 4 fullstack developers (2 senior, 2 junior)
- A balanced workload that's realistic for the team composition

## Tickets for User Story 1: User Registration

### Ticket 1: Research Authentication Frameworks

Estimation : 3 story points (reduced from 5)

Rationale: With 2 senior developers available, this research can be completed more efficiently. This is a focused task that should take less than half a sprint for an experienced developer.

### Ticket 2: Design User Registration Database Schema

Estimation : 2 story points (reduced from 3)

Rationale: Database schema design is a focused task that a senior developer can complete efficiently, especially with clear requirements already defined.

### Ticket 3: Implement User Registration API Endpoints

Estimation : 5 story points (reduced from 8)

Rationale: While this is still substantial work, having senior developers who can guide the implementation reduces the overall effort needed.

### Ticket 4: Develop User Registration UI Component

Estimation : 3 story points (reduced from 5)

Rationale: UI component development can be handled by junior developers with guidance, and the complexity is moderate.

### Ticket 5: Implement Email Verification System

Estimation : 3 story points (reduced from 5)

Rationale: This is a well-defined task that can be implemented with existing libraries and patterns.

### Ticket 6: Integration Testing for User Registration Flow

Estimation : 2 story points (reduced from 3)

Rationale: With proper test planning, this can be completed efficiently, especially if automated testing frameworks are used.

## Tickets for User Story 2: User Authentication

### Ticket 7: Implement Authentication API Endpoints

Estimation : 5 story points (reduced from 8)

Rationale: Similar to the registration endpoints, this work can be completed more efficiently with senior developers guiding the implementation.

### Ticket 8: Develop Login UI Component

Estimation : 2 story points (reduced from 5)

Rationale: This is simpler than the registration UI and can be implemented quickly, especially with reusable components from the registration form.

### Ticket 9: Implement Password Recovery Functionality

Estimation : 5 story points (reduced from 8)

Rationale: This spans both frontend and backend but can leverage patterns established in the email verification system.

### Ticket 10: Implement Session Management

Estimation : 3 story points (reduced from 5)

Rationale: With the authentication framework research completed, implementing session management should be more straightforward.

### Ticket 11: Create Authentication Middleware

Estimation : 3 story points (reduced from 5)

Rationale: This is a focused technical task that can be implemented efficiently by a senior developer.

### Ticket 12: Integration Testing for Authentication Flow

Estimation : 2 story points (reduced from 3)

Rationale: Similar to the registration testing, this can be completed efficiently with proper test planning.

## Sprint Planning Considerations

With these adjusted story points, the total for all tickets is 38 story points. For a team of 4 developers over a 2-week sprint, this is a reasonable workload if we assume:

- Each developer can handle approximately 8-10 story points per sprint
- Senior developers can take on more complex tasks
- Junior developers can work on UI components and simpler tasks with guidance
- Some tasks can be worked on in parallel
  This would allow the team to complete both user stories within a single sprint, with some capacity remaining for addressing unexpected issues or technical debt.

# Prompt

are those story points estimation following some specific methodology? fibonacci, poker, shirt sizes? what is behind?

# Response

The story point estimation in the document appears to be following the Fibonacci sequence methodology, which is a common approach in Agile estimation.

In the Fibonacci estimation technique, story points follow the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) rather than using consecutive numbers. This approach recognizes that estimation becomes less precise as complexity increases, which is why the gaps between values grow larger as the numbers get higher.

Looking at the adjusted story point values in the document (2, 3, 5), these align with the Fibonacci sequence. The original estimates before adjustment (3, 5, 8) also follow this pattern.

The benefit of using Fibonacci numbers for estimation is that it:

1. Prevents false precision in estimates
2. Forces the team to make more meaningful distinctions between complexity levels
3. Acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in software development tasks
4. Makes it easier for teams to reach consensus during planning poker sessions
   The statement that "each developer can handle approximately 8-10 story points per sprint" is referring to velocity, which is the amount of work a team member can complete in a sprint, measured in story points.

# Prompt

change the estimation to use t-shirts methodology

# Response

'll adjust the estimation to use the T-shirt sizing methodology instead of story points. T-shirt sizing is a relative estimation technique that uses sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL to represent the effort required for each task.

Here's how I would convert the current estimations to T-shirt sizes:

### Ticket 5: Implement Email Verification System

Estimation : M (Medium) (changed from 3 story points)

Rationale : This is a well-defined task that can be implemented with existing libraries and patterns. It has moderate complexity that fits well with a Medium t-shirt size, representing a task that would take a developer a few days to complete.

For the other tickets, I would recommend the following T-shirt size conversions:

- 2 story points → S (Small)
- 3 story points → M (Medium)
- 5 story points → L (Large)
- 8+ story points → XL (Extra Large)
  T-shirt sizing provides a more intuitive way to communicate relative effort and can be easier for stakeholders to understand compared to numerical story points.

# Prompt

give me again the whole tickets for the first 2 user stories modifying the story points to be t-shirt sizes only. Keep the rest of the tickets untouched.

# Response

# Work Tickets with T-Shirt Size Estimation

I'll provide the tickets for the first two user stories with the story points converted to T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL), while keeping all other information the same.
